# Alien Invasion
This is a solo project based on the classic game of Space Invaders.

A fleet of aliens attack from the above while moving left to right and moving down the screen on our ship consistently.
We have options to move side to side on the screen and shoot bullets to kill the aliens.

This is a simple take on the cult classic that inspired generations worth of gamers.

Main motive of this project was to iron out the advanced programming in Python while having fun!!
